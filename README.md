 GeostratPoe
 -------------------------------------------
GeoStrat is an app that our development team developed to serve as a basic local landmark guide. 
The software helps users locate nearby landmarks, such as monuments, parks, and other attractions. 
The software gives the user directions for the quickest path to a specific landmark. 
The user may see this location data via an aesthetically pleasing GUI, and it uses the GPS to track the user's location, so they always know where they are.

Technology used:
------------------------------------------
•	Android Studio (Java) 
•	Firestore as the database to our apps data as well as for security purposes through the use of its authentication services. 
•	Google API’s such as google maps and places inorder for our development team to utilize google’s mapping services.
•	Git to facilitate coordination, sharing, and collaboration across the entire software development team.
